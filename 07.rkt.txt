; circumference : Number -> Number
; GIVEN: the radius r of a circle 
; RETURNS: its circumference, using the formula 2 * pi * r.
; Examples:
; (circumference 1)  =>  6.283185307179586 
; (circumference 0)  =>  0
; DESIGN STRATEGY: Domain Knowledge
; FUNCTION DEFINITION :
  (define (circumference r)
    (* pi r)   
   )
; TESTS
  

  (check-equal? (circumference 0) 0 "Circumference of a circle with radius 0 is 0")
